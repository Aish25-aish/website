TechGadget Store - Landing and Thank You Pages
This repository contains two simple HTML files for a basic tech product store: a landing page to showcase products and a thank you page for successful purchases.

Files Included
tech_landing_page.html:

Description: This is the main landing page designed to display two fictional tech products (Quantum Processor X1 and NeuralLink Headset Pro).

Features:

Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

Product cards with images, descriptions, prices, and "Buy Now" buttons.

Header and footer sections.

Navigation: The "Buy Now" buttons link to checkout.html, passing a product query parameter. (Note: checkout.html is not included in this README and would need to be created separately.)

thank_you_page.html:

Description: A simple page displayed after a successful purchase, thanking the customer.

Features:

Clear "Thank You!" message and a success icon.

Confirmation of order placement.

A message about email confirmation and tracking.

A "Continue Shopping" button linking back to index.html (assuming tech_landing_page.html is renamed to index.html).

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design. (Loaded via CDN).

Google Fonts (Inter): For modern typography.

How to Use
To view these pages:

Save the content of tech_landing_page.html as index.html (or keep its current name).

Save the content of thank_you_page.html as thankyou.html.

Open index.html in your web browser.

Note: These are static HTML files. For actual e-commerce functionality (like adding items to a cart, processing payments, etc.), you would need to implement backend logic and potentially more complex frontend JavaScript.

Next Steps (Potential Enhancements)
Create checkout.html to handle the purchasing process.

Add JavaScript for dynamic content or interactive elements.

Integrate a proper e-commerce platform or payment gateway.

Implement client-side form validation.

Expand product listings.
